A vector has:
- magnitude (the length of the vector)
- direction (the angle relative to some axis)

Ex Bouncing balls:
- Ball (
    location vector, 
    velocity vector,
    moveBall func(),
    checkBounce func(),
    drawBall func())
Description: A ball that moves based on it's position and
velocity, it bounces back if it reaches the border.
